The project was done in order to complete the assignment of FIT3003 - Business Intelligence and Data Warehousing, Monash University Malaysia in Semester 2 2020. The assignment was done in group, thus I would like to put credit to my awesome teammates:

MonChef is a food business run by Monash University in Clayton. It has 2 business segments: canteen and catering. Therefore, the management frequently generates reports to keep track of the business, which later can be used for forecasting various trends and making predictions about the food business.

MonChef is currently having an existing operational database which maintains and stores all of the buesiness transaction information required for the management's daily operation. However, the staffs have limited database knowledge, thus the management wishes to hire Data Warehouse Engineers to:
- Design data warehousing system
- Develop the system
- Quickly generate reports

<strong>The answer is now modified for portfolio purpose.</strong>
